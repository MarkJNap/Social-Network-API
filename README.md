# Social-Network-API

## Description

For this application I was using MongoDB to get out of my comfort zone of using MySQL and Sequelize. In doing so I have created an API for a social network. This social network has the ability for users to add or remove friends, modify and delete their account. As well as the ability to create posts (known as `thoughts`) and all the familiar CRUD routes for that. This challenge was a good learning experience for me and pushed my knowledge of Models and dealing with a NoSQL style database.

## Installation

* Node.js v16
* MongoDB
* GitBash or equivalent
* Insomnia or equivalent

After cloning repository and navigating to correct folder in GitBash the user needs to run `npm install` to ensure it downloads all needed packages/dependencies.

**Note:**
Check mongoose package should be version 6.9.2.

## Usage

To begin type the command `npm start`.
Then open Insomnia at `http://localhost:3001/`.

This application allows the user to interact with our database.
In insomnia you are able to get, create, update, and delete Users. As well as have all those routes for Thoughts.
You also have access to be able to create and delete Reactions to Thoughts and are able to add and remove friends from Users.
